# 🐾 Animal Image Classification using TensorFlow

This project is a simple deep learning application that uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images of animals — specifically **cats**, **dogs**, **lions**, and **elephants**.

## 🧠 Objective

The goal is to train a model that can correctly identify the animal present in an image. This helps beginners understand how image data can be processed and classified using TensorFlow and Keras.
